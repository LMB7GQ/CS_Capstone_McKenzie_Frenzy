How to make it work

first set up either generatedata or generateharddata as the startup item and run the program. this will fill the csv files with new info.
	
	the generate hard data makes it so there are 3 clumps of simlar users so should get somewhat simlar results

	for generate data you can decide how many users and items(games). you can also decide odds someone plays a game or not

After the csv file is full you should just set the main.py as the startup item and run.Then it should give results in the console.
